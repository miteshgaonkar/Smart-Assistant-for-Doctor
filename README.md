# Smart-Assistant-for-Doctor

## Overview
This project implements a smart disease detection portal designed to aid healthcare professionals in quickly diagnosing diseases based on patient symptoms. By inputting patient symptoms, the portal utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict potential diseases, provide medication suggestions, and recommend pathology tests. The system aims to streamline the diagnostic process, enabling doctors to make informed decisions efficiently.

## Key Features
- Symptom Input: Doctors can input patient symptoms through a user-friendly interface.
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Utilizes decision tree, random forest, and naive Bayes algorithms for disease prediction.
- Medication Suggestions: Provides medication suggestions tailored to the predicted diseases.
- Pathology Test Recommendations: Recommends pathology tests based on predicted diseases.
- Patient Registration: Allows for the registration of new patients, storing their details securely.
- Doctor Authentication: Secure login system for doctors to access the portal's features.

## How to Use
- Patient Symptom Input: Doctors input patient symptoms via the graphical user interface.
- Disease Prediction: The portal predicts potential diseases based on the entered symptoms using machine learning algorithms.
- Medication and Test Recommendations: After disease prediction, the system suggests appropriate medications and pathology tests.
- Patient Registration: New patients can be registered, capturing their details for future reference.
- Doctor Authentication: Secure login ensures only authorized healthcare professionals can access the portal.
